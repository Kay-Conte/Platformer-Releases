# Platformer-Releases
Game is currently in Primitive stages and unplayable as a real game. 

Any bugs reported to me on the *latest release* are appreciated but useless without steps to reproduce. Report anything to rKay#3822 on discord.

I am aware the phsyics become more innacurate the more blocks you add on screen. This is simply the nature of my engine and the fact that there are too many blocks colliding at once.

Controls:
WASD to move
Space or W to jump
T to spawn many blocks
G to spawn one block

Current Features
-Player movement
-Player Animations

Testing Features:
-Spawnable blocks

Next Todo:
-More player animations
-Wall jumping
-Dashing mechanic
-Player Health
